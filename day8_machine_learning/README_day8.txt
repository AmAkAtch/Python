Machine learning is a way to teach computers to learn patterns from the data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed
- Pedict outcomes
- Automate tasks
- uncover insights

Linear regression - It assumed a straight line relationships like...
price = manufacturing price*1.5 + 30 

For machine learning 
each row is datappoint -> 1 observation
each column is feature -> ad spend, tv_spend, model spend for that observation. 
When you have 1D series, Its flat and has no information like what is datapoint and what is feature
When you have 2D array, It even though it might have only 1 column, that is one feature for different observations(row)

Training on all Data risks memorising the data, overfitting model
