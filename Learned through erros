You can't parse entire column like this
int(sales_data.Sales)

plt.plot(x=sales_data.Month, y=sales_data.Sales, data=sales_data) - This is matplotlib and Seaborn mixed - You don't pass arguments like this in matplotlib - in matplotlib you directly pass the values as parameteres

to get the index using numpy you have to use
np.argmax()

While using iloc you are accessing the row so
dataframe.iloc[] -> is the right choice
dataframe.iloc() -> is the wrong choice

While trying to get the cell in datafram
dataframe.iloc[index, "column_name"] => is wrong and gives error
dataframe.iloc[index, dataframe.column.get_loc("colume_name")] -> is the right choice and will select colum for that specific index

use iloc when accessing rows based on interger based position access, and use loc when doind label based position acess
iloc[] - give me the row at position... - Good where the default indexing is used
loc[] - give me the row where the label is... - Good where the custom indexing is used like dates
iloc[2,1] - row 3, column 2
loc[2,"MOnth"] - give me the row where index label is 2 and column name is Month
