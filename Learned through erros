You can't parse entire column like this
int(sales_data.Sales)

plt.plot(x=sales_data.Month, y=sales_data.Sales, data=sales_data) - This is matplotlib and Seaborn mixed - You don't pass arguments like this in matplotlib - in matplotlib you directly pass the values as parameteres

to get the index using numpy you have to use
np.argmax()

While using iloc you are accessing the row so
dataframe.iloc[] -> is the right choice
dataframe.iloc() -> is the wrong choice

While trying to get the cell in datafram
dataframe.iloc[index, "column_name"] => is wrong and gives error
dataframe.iloc[index, dataframe.column.get_loc("colume_name")] -> is the right choice and will select colum for that specific index
